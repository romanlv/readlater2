modular architecture 
- add more storage options through new modules
invest in TDD early on 
use V0 to generate nice UI 

## storage 
store lists in google sheets, that makes it easy to share with others 
ability add multiple lists, so different accounts can contribute  
 

## features 

- dark mode, themes
- offline support 
- different storage options
- save articles for offline reading
- PWA 
- preview
- tags, notes, comments 
- (optional) reading mode, fetch articles text only
- chrome extension to save articles for later
- specify spreadsheet to save to, support multiple spreadsheets, call them lists


## nice to have
- highlight text and add notes inside the article


## code examples / technology demonstrations

- share link to PWA app 
- save/load from google sheets 
- offline support 
- tests (unit or integration) for PWA
- bundler? liner, test framework 
- monorepo
- pnpm 

## testing 

- unit tests with  Vitest, React Testing Library, Mcw

## ideas 
- highlight text and share TLDR version of the article

## data structure 

when saving to spreadsheet, define columns and mapping to the data
