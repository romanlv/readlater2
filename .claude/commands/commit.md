commit changes and push

- commit changes, keep the commit message short and clear
- DO NOT mention Cladue or Anthropic in notes
- skip adding "Created by" section
- mention only featuers inculded in the pr, not the issues that were introduced and fixed during development
- skip adding "Test plan" in PR description, it should be tested already by developer
